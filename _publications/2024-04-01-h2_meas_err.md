<!-- **Abstract**. In prospective genomic studies (e.g., DNA methylation, metagenomics, and transcriptomics), it
is crucial to estimate the overall fraction of phenotypic variance (OFPV) attributed to the highdimensional
genomic variables, a concept similar to heritability analyses in genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). Unlike genetic variants in GWAS, these genomic variables are typically measured
with error due to technical limitation and temporal instability. While the existing methods developed
for GWAS can be used, ignoring measurement error may severely underestimate OFPV and
mislead the design of future studies. Assuming that measurement error variances are distributed
similarly between causal and noncausal variables, we show that the asymptotic attenuation factor
equals to the average intraclass correlation coefficients of all genomic variables, which can be estimated
based on a pilot study with repeated measurements. We illustrate the method by estimating
the contribution of microbiome taxa to body mass index and multiple allergy traits in the American
Gut Project. Finally, we show that measurement error does not cause meaningful bias when
estimating the correlation of effect sizes for two traits. -->
