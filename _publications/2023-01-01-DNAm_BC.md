<!-- **Abstract**. Tumor subtype and menopausal status are strong predictors of breast cancer (BC)
prognosis. We aimed to find and validate subtype- or menopausal-status-specific
changes in tumor DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with all-cause mortality or
BC progression. Associations between site-specific tumor DNAm and BC
prognosis were estimated among The Cancer Genome Atlas participants (n =
692) with Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array data. All-cause
mortality and BC progression were modeled using Cox proportional hazards
models stratified by tumor subtypes, adjusting for age, race, stage, menopausal
status, tumor purity, and cell type proportion. Effect measure modification by
subtype and menopausal status were evaluated by incorporating a product term
with DNAm. Site-specific inference was used to identify subtype- or menopausalstatus-
specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and functional pathways.
The validation of the results was carried out on an independent dataset
(GSE72308; n = 180). We identified a total of fifteen unique CpG probes that
were significantly associated (P ≤1 × 10−7) with survival outcomes in subtype- or
menopausal-status-specific manner. Seven probes were associated with overall
survival (OS) or progression-free interval (PFI) for women with luminal A subtype,
and four probes were associated with PFI for women with luminal B subtype. Five
probes were associated with PFI for post-menopausal women. A majority of
significant probes showed a lower risk of OS or BC progression with higher DNAm.
We identified subtype- or menopausal-status-specific DMRs and functional
pathways of which top associated pathways differed across subtypes or
menopausal status. None of significant probes from site-specific analyses met
genome-wide significant level in validation analyses while directions and
magnitudes of coefficients showed consistent pattern. We have identified
subtype- or menopausal-status-specific DNAm biomarkers, DMRs and
functional pathways associated with all-cause mortality or BC progression,
albeit with limited validation. Future studies with larger independent cohort of
non-post-menopausal women with non-luminal A subtypes are warranted for
identifying subtype- and menopausal-status-specific DNAm biomarkers for BC
prognosis. -->
