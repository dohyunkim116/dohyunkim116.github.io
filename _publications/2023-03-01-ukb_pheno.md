<!-- **Abstract**. A modern biobank-scale health care data linked with electronic health care records such as UK Biobank (UKB) provide
researchers with a tremendous opportunity to study disease progression and associated risk factors. To study disease progression,
researchers often use time-to-event statistical analysis. However, time-to-event data are not readily available from
primary sources of healthcare data and require concerted efforts to create them. In this paper, we introduce modularized
procedures for systematically phenotyping time-to-event outcomes at large scale. We consistently and accurately curate biomarker
trajectory data and define relevant disease outcomes and event times. Adapting our procedures to datasets from the
UKB study and using diabetes-related complications as examples, we curate trajectory data of diabetes risk factors and phenotype
time to the onset of diabetes vascular complications (ie, cardiovascular complications, diabetic kidney disease, and
diabetic retinopathy). This allows us to assess the effects of several known risk factors for the onset of diabetes complications.
A risk prediction analysis shows prediction accuracy consistent with the ones obtained from standard risk prediction
models using cohort studies. -->
